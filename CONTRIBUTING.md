# Contributing to Awesome Cloud Native

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This list is curated by [Podo Stack](https://podostack.substack.com), but we welcome suggestions from the community.

## How to suggest a tool

1. **Open an issue** using the [suggest tool template](https://github.com/iGusev/awesome-cloud-native/issues/new?template=suggest-tool.md)
2. Provide the required information:
   - Tool name and GitHub link
   - One-line description (what it does)
   - Why it belongs here (production-readiness, unique value)

## Criteria for inclusion

Tools should be:

- **Production-ready** — Used in real production environments, not just demos
- **Actively maintained** — Recent commits, responsive maintainers
- **Solves a real problem** — Not just "cool tech" but actually useful
- **Cloud native** — Works with Kubernetes, containers, or cloud infrastructure

We're especially interested in:

- CNCF projects (Sandbox, Incubating, Graduated)
- Tools that solve problems in non-obvious ways
- "Hidden gems" that deserve more attention

## Format

Each entry should follow this format:

```markdown
- **[Tool Name](https://github.com/org/tool)** - One-line description that explains what it does and why it's useful. `Badge`
  - 📖 [Deep dive](https://podostack.substack.com/p/slug) (optional)
```

**Badges:**
- `CNCF Graduated` — Mature CNCF project
- `CNCF Incubating` — Growing CNCF project
- `CNCF Sandbox` — Early-stage CNCF project
- No badge — Production-ready but not CNCF

## What we don't include

- Paid-only tools (open source core required)
- Abandoned projects (no commits in 12+ months)
- Tools that duplicate existing entries without clear differentiation
- Self-promotion without substance

## Pull Requests

If you want to submit a PR directly:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your tool in the appropriate category
3. Follow the format above
4. Submit a PR with a clear description

We'll review and merge if it fits our criteria.
